# AnyCloud Example: Wi-Fi Scan

This example demonstrates how to configure different scan filters provided in the Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM) middleware and scan for the available Wi-Fi networks. 

The example initializes the Wi-Fi device and starts a Wi-Fi scan without any filter and prints the results on the serial terminal. Press the user button to change the type of scan filter applied and print the scan results on the serial terminal. Press the button again to observe the scan output for a different scan filter. The type of scan filter applied wraps around to no filter when the number of button presses exceeds the number of supported scan filters.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.


## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**. You can also access it from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. 

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the *Exporting to IDEs* section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3USB connector.

2. Add the filter parameters to the macros `SCAN_FOR_SSID_VALUE`, `MAC_ADDRESS`, `SCAN_FOR_BAND_VALUE`, and `SCAN_FOR_RSSI_VALUE` defined in *scan_task.h*.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   - **Using CLI**:

       From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example:

        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

   By default, there is no scan filter applied as shown in the sample output:

    **Figure 1. Scan Output with No Filter**
    ![](images/figure1.png)

**Note**: The serial terminal output will contain duplicate SSID scan results.

5. Press the user button to switch to the *SSID scan filter*, which scans for only the network whose SSID is provided in `SCAN_FOR_SSID_VALUE`. 

    **Figure 2. Scan Output with SSID Filter**
    ![](images/figure2.png)

6. Press the user button SW2 to switch to the *MAC address scan filter*, which scans for only the network whose MAC address is provided in `MAC_ADDRESS`. 

    **Figure 3. Scan Output with MAC Address**
    ![](images/figure3.png)

7. Press the user button SW2 to switch to the *ISM band scan filter*, which scans for only the networks which advertize in the frequency band provided in `SCAN_FOR_BAND_VALUE`. 

    **Figure 4. Scan Output with Frequency Band Filter**
    ![](images/figure4.png)

8. Press the user button SW2 to switch to the *RSSI range scan filter*, which scans for only the networks whose RSSI is better than the RSSI provided in `SCAN_FOR_RSSI_VALUE`. 

    **Figure 5. Scan Output with RSSI Filter**
    ![](images/figure5.png)

9. Press the button again to wrap around to scan with no filter.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

The main function initializes the button SW2, user LED, UART, and creates `scan_task` before starting the FreeRTOS scheduler. The `scan_task` is responsible for initializing the Wi-Fi device and starting the scan based on the filter type. The WCM middleware supports the following filter types:

1. No Filter: As the name indicates, all the Wi-Fi networks are provided to the scan callback function.

2. Filtering for SSID: The scan callback receives only the networks whose SSID matches with the SSID filter parameter.

3. Filtering for MAC Address: The scan callback receives only the networks whose MAC address matches with the MAC address filter parameter.

4. Filtering for Frequency Band: The scan callback receives only the networks which are advertising in the frequency band provided as the filter parameter.

   **Note**: CY8CPROTO-062-4343W is a single-band device; it can detect only those networks occupying the 2.4-GHz band.

5. Filtering for RSSI: The scan callback receives only the networks which have RSSI greater than the RSSI provided as the filter parameter.

The scan callback function is executed under the context of the WCM middleware's worker thread. After the scan is completed, the scan callback sends a task notification to `scan_task` because the `cy_wcm_start_scan` is a non-blocking function and returns without waiting for the scan to complete.

In this example, you can switch to a different type of filter by pressing the user button SW2. An ISR increments the `scan_filter_mode_select` global variable of the `scan_filter_mode` enumeration type to let `scan_task` know the type of the filter to be applied. The value of `scan_filter_mode` is reset to `SCAN_FILTER_NONE` when the variable is incremented to `SCAN_FILTER_INVALID`.
